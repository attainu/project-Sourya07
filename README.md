This is a complete Chess game written in Python. It strictly follow the Chess rules and have features:

-Regular moves and captures of Pawn, Bishop, Rook, Night, Queen and King.
-Special moves like Castling and Pawn promotion.
-Disallow illegal moves that give away the king
-Features like impossible checkmate and stalemate are given.
-Keep chess records and allow undo steps.

To run this project, you can create a new python project in Pycharm, copy files in the
root folder into the project folder and others into the src folder. Simply run the Main to
start the game, and then you see your Chess window.

To make a move in the game, you can click on the chess piece and then again on the
square you want to drop your piece. The UI ability makes it very easy for user to make
move.
